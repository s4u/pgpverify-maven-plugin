 * A failure strategy that will retry up to N times, backing off a longer period of time between
 * attempts to allow the target server to recover.

 * <p>By default, this strategy will allow retrying up to ten times, with an additional 2000
 * milliseconds more per attempt, before giving up. The delay between retries and maximum number of
 * retries can be controlled by using the {@link #BackoffStrategy(long, int)} constructor.
 *
 * <p>As expected, instances of this strategy maintain a retry counter. For this
 * reason, after a request has been completed, the same failure strategy
 * instance should not be used for a subsequent request. A new failure strategy
 * instance should be created for each new request (excluding retries of the
 * same request).
